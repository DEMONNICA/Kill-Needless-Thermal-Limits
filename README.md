> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features ✨:
> 1. Brutal Daemon Kill terminates and blocks all thermal services and daemons. ✔️
> 2. Aggressive and adaptive thermal kill for `QCOM and MTK` platforms. ✔️
> 3. Brutal Thermal Throttling Killer prevents system-enforced performance limits. ✔️
> 4. Intelligent Thermal Kill dynamically detects and overrides thermal values and parameters. ✔️
> 5. Sets all thermal trip points to extremely high thresholds (125°C+). ✔️
> 6. Forces GPU governor into `performance` mode and disables GPU throttling paths. ✔️
> 7. Forces CPU governor into `performance` mode and locks it persistently. ✔️
> 8. Locks thermal sysfs nodes and critical parameters to prevent reactivation at runtime. ✔️
> 9. Automatically adapts execution based on root environment and detected SoC (QCOM / MTK). ✔️
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Supports `Magisk` `APatch` `SukiSU` `KernelSU` and `other variants`.
